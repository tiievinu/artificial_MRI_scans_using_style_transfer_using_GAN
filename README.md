# artificial_MRI_scans_using_style_transfer_using_GAN
Capstone_Project, IIITB and UPGRAD, to translate the style of one MRI image to another.

Misdiagnosis or incorrect diagnosis in the medical field is a very serious issue but unfortunately, it’s a common occurrence. Imaging procedures in the medical field require an expert radiologist’s opinion since interpreting them is not a simple binary process ( Normal or Abnormal). Even so, one radiologist may see something that another does not. This can lead to conflicting reports and make it difficult to effectively recommend the optimal treatment options to the patient.
 
One of the complicated tasks in medical imaging is to diagnose MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging) scans. Sometimes to interpret the scan, the radiologist needs different variations of the imaging techniques to drastically enhance the accuracy of diagnosis by providing practitioners with a more comprehensive understanding. But to have access to different imaging techniques is difficult & expensive. 
 
With the help of deep learning, we can use style transfer to generate artificial MRI images of differing contrast levels from existing MRI scans. This will help provide a better diagnosis with the help of an additional image.
