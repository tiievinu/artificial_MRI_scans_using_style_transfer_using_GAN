Capstone_Project, IIITB and UPGRAD, to build a Generative adversarial model(modified U-Net) which can generate artificial MRI images of different contrast levels from existing MRI scans.

Misdiagnosis or incorrect diagnosis in the medical field is a very serious issue but unfortunately, it’s a common occurrence. Imaging procedures in the medical field require an expert radiologist’s opinion since interpreting them is not a simple binary process ( Normal or Abnormal). Even so, one radiologist may see something that another does not. This can lead to conflicting reports and make it difficult to effectively recommend the optimal treatment options to the patient.
 
One of the complicated tasks in medical imaging is to diagnose MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging) scans. Sometimes to interpret the scan, the radiologist needs different variations of the imaging techniques to drastically enhance the accuracy of diagnosis by providing practitioners with a more comprehensive understanding. But to have access to different imaging techniques is difficult & expensive. 
 
With the help of deep learning, we can use style transfer to generate artificial MRI images of differing contrast levels from existing MRI scans. This will help provide a better diagnosis with the help of an additional image. 
 
Different MRIs are required for different abnormalities. A single type of MRI may not be sufficient for the diagnosis of an abnormality. Additional MRIs might enhance the accuracy of diagnosis, leading to better treatment of the patient.
 
Access to different imaging techniques is difficult and expensive. Moreover, doctors may advise getting one type of MRI to be done at a time, which makes it a time-consuming process. This capstone helps you address this problem with the help of an exciting tool in the deep learning domain, which is known as Generative Adversarial Networks or GANs.
 
Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have been used for generating deepfakes, new fashion styles and high-resolution pictures from the low-resolution ones. Recently, Nvidia developed Gau-GAN, which can translate mere sketches into beautiful sceneries, which itself is a testament to the power of GANs.
